    <h2>Updating event results</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to www.wags.org/wagsadmin
        <li>Click on "Events"
        <li>Click on the arrow for <b>Results</b> against the event
        <li>The screen shown will allow you to enter total scores by player but it is not recommended to enter at this level.
        The initial order is alphabetic by player name. As you enter scores (see next point), the screen will be
        automatically updated with the total score and the results reordered.
        <li>The list of players comes from the bookings. If a player is missing from the list, they can be added using
        the Add Player button at the bottom of the screen</li>
        <li>In order to capture a player's score by hole, click on <b>Card</b> for a player.
        This is recommended and enables reports such as Big Swing.
        <li>To enter the card for a player, you give the shots per hole. The simplest way to enter them is to enter the
        shots for a hole and press tab to go to the next. The screen will update with the points scored
        and maintain a running total for front nine, back nine and overall total. If the points calculated differs
        from the points recorded on the card or the totals differ (this can happen!), check that you've read the card
        correctly and make a management decision about how to deal with it.
        After the 18th, tab will take you to the <b>Save</b> button (at the bottom).
        <li>Press enter or click on the <b>Save</b> button to save the card. Press the browser Back button to cancel without saving.
        You will be returned to the event results screen which will be automatically updated with the total score for
        the player and the results re-ordered.
        <li>Once all the score have been entered, go the the News section and add a new news item.</li>
