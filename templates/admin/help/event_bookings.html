<h2>Updating event bookings</h2>
Prior to an event going "live", this allows you to edit the bookings for the event - Add or remove players, change a
guest name or handicap.
<p>It also allows adding all players for a Tour.
<p>It is important to have a complete and correct list of players (with handicaps for guests) for an event in order to
    enter the scores.</p>
